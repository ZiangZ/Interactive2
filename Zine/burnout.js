  '<br>"It is not about cash, or even about code. <br>It is about treating maintainers like human beings."<br><br>The main issue arises when a module or library that <br> we depend on gets compromised, automatically the <br>vulnerability propagates to our software project. <br>Itâ€™s fair to notice that this propagation does not mean <br>that we are thus affected by a potential attack but it <br>remains a risk that we need to evaluate, control and <br>mitigate and that it requires knowledge inside the <br>organization that uses those affected software components.<br><br>Many third-party components are open source and its <br>maintenance relies on a given community that can vary <br>in sizes. In many cases the weight of the maintenance falls <br>in the shoulders of one or two main contributors that keep <br>the project up-to-date and make incremental improvements. <br><br>Here is where the burnout concept kicks in. Maintaining a <br>popular library or module requires a ton of work from reviewing<br> contributions, handling communication and analyzing the <br>roadmap of the project to keep it moving forward in the right <br>direction, but returns are often not at sight. When the<br> maintainer sees that the library is widely used its maintenance <br>it is not proportionally shared by the community, burnout <br>increases and we head into a fertile field for an attacker <br>to step in and offer help and gain the permissions <br>needed to perform its attack.'];
