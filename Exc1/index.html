        Back in 2013, Stephen King published a long-awaited <br>
          follow-up to his 1970s horror opus (one of his many, <br>
          many, many opuses), The Shining. The sequel centers <br>
          around a grown-up Dan Torrance who, naturally, <br>
          is still pretty messed up from the whole "dad losing <br>
          his mind and going on a murderous spree while he was <br>
          a little boy with inexplicable psychic powers" thing. <br>
          The book didn't live up to the overwhelming expectations <br>
          that the original left, but it was still a grim and gripping<br>
          read and one of the best things King's written this decade,<br>
          right behind 11/22/63.<br><br>
        </p>

          Now, Doctor Sleep is being adapted to the big screen <br>
          by Mike Flanagan, the guy who recently helmed Gerald's Game,<br>
          and starring Ewan McGregor as Torrance. It seems like this <br>
          one is gearing up to be a must-see for any Shining fans, <br>
          regardless of how you felt about the source material—because <br>
          Flanagan has somehow rebuilt Stanley Kubrick's entire <br>
          Overlook Hotel set from Kubrick's original blueprints, <br>
          Slashfilm reports.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Jacob Hall from Slashfilm headed down to Atlanta for <br>
          a Doctor Sleep set tour with Flanagan last year and is finally<br>
          speaking out about his experience, which, by all accounts, <br>
          sounds fully incredible. Here's Hall, describing his experience<br> 
          walking into the soundstage and entering the flawlessly<br>
          recreated Overlook set:<br>
          
        </p>
        <h3>
        "We walk through a set of doors. And we’re in the Overlook Hotel, <br>
          the obscenely haunted hotel from Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 horror <br>
          masterpiece, The Shining. Specifically, we’re in the Colorado Lounge, <br>
          the sprawling space where Jack Nicholson’s Jack Torrance wrote<br>
          “All work and no play make Jack a dull boy” thousands of times. <br>
          The space where Wendy Torrance confronts her husband with a <br>
          baseball bat. The space Danny rides his big wheel through in so <br>
          many icy tracking shots."<br><br>
        </h3>
        <p>
          
        
        Doctor Sleep is set to hit theaters November 8 and, no matter how <br>
          good or bad it winds up being, at least we'll be able to appreciate<br>
          the meticulous, obsessive care that went into making it happen.<br>
